Biodiversity ontologies created by the biosemantics group and collaborators. 


The two modifier ontologies were created by following the literary warrant and user warrant principles of the national standard on constructing controlled vocabularies, using the list ontology pattern. The ontologies address four types of modifier terms (frequency, certainty, degree, and coverage) that are used widely in describing phenotype characters but have not been treated by existing ontologies. 


The Carex Ontology was created for the Authors in Driver's Seat project (NSF award # 1661485). The article "Helping Authors Produce FAIR Taxonomic Data: Evaluation of an Author-Driven Phenotype Data Production Platform" describes how it was created based on the terms extracted from Carex descriptions in Flora of North America using ETC Ontology Builder tool (http://etc.sbs.arizona.edu/etcsite/).
