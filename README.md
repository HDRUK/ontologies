Biodiversity ontologies created by the biosemantics group and collaborators. 


The two modifier ontologies were created by following the literary warrant and user warrant principles of the national standard on constructing controlled vocabularies, using the list ontology pattern. The ontologies address four types of modifier terms (frequency, certainty, degree, and coverage) that are used widely in describing phenotype characters but have not been treated by existing ontologies.
